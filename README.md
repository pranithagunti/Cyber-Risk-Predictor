**AI CYBER RISK ANALYZER -  (Streamlit-based)**

---

**🔍 ABOUT THE PROJECT**

This is a simple **AI App** built using **Streamlit** that simulates a Cyber Risk Analyzer. It uses a **pretrained machine learning model** to predict cybersecurity behavior based on inputs like device usage, awareness, and network behavior. The app demonstrates how Generative AI and classical AI models can be used for educational or analytical purposes in cybersecurity training.
