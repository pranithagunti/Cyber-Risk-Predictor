**AI CYBER RISK ANALYZER -  (Streamlit-based)**

---

**🔍 ABOUT THE PROJECT**

This is a simple **AI App** built using **Streamlit** that simulates a Cyber Risk Analyzer. Cyber Risk Analyzer is a machine learning-based application that analyzes various factors to predict the cyber risk level (e.g., low, medium, high) of an organization. It is designed to help companies assess their vulnerability to cyber threats using AI-driven insights
